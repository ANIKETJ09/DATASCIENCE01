Q 20 Write a function called ‘perform_hypothesis_test’ that takes two lists of numbers as input, representing two samples. 
The function should perform a two-sample t-test and return the p-value. Use the ‘scipy.stats’ module in Python to calculate the 
t-test and p-value.


from scipy import stats

def hypothesis_test(sample1, sample2):
    t_statistic, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(sample1, sample2)
    return p_value

Sample1 = [15, 27, 95, 20, 55]
Sample2 = [11, 28, 37, 98, 53]
p_value = hypothesis_test(Sample1, Sample2)
print("P-value:", p_value)

P-value: 0.8897891471711694
